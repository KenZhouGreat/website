					<h3>We are Hey Inc. And we're building something that we think you'll like.</h3>
				</div> -->
				<p>We’re building Post-A-Vox so consumers can raise their voices, anywhere, anytime.  Post-A-Vox allows consumers to create a private message in a few seconds, to any of the thousands of businesses or government agencies that serve them.  For free.  Their message is then instantly delivered to the organisation who may then respond via Post-a-Vox, or directly by phone or email.  Also for free. Globally, organisations spend billions of dollars each year on the people and systems required to engage with consumers and citizens who provide feedback.   Post-A-Vox is a disruptive technology which will attract mass transactions by leveraging the convenience of mobile devices.   Business and government will get a radical new channel for personal engagement with consumers on the move, and we’re developing add-on tools to help organisations to be more responsive. The Post-A-Vox team are all either technologists or complaint-handling professionals.</p>
