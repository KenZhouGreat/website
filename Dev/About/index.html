Anyone who has used a computer to complain via a website knows it can be a frustrating and time-consuming experience. It’s even harder from a mobile device.</p><p>A lot of complaints go un-logged because of these obstacles.</p><p>We think it’s time to put consumers in control.</p><p>Post-A-Vox is a comfortable, straightforward and graceful way to complain from a mobile. Not just to one organisation, but any organisation. No lumps.</p></div><div class="lower"><div class="team cell"><div class="amazingPicture" style="background-image: url(../Resources/Images/Andrew.png)"></div><div class="cellTitle"><h3>Andrew Taylor</h3></div><p>Andrew is a co-founder of Post-A-Vox and has spent years advising government agencies and household names on how to make it easy for people to complain.</p><p>As a career technology entrepreneur, he founded both the <a href="http://www.satisfy.com.au/html/s01_home/home.asp?dsb=25" target="_blank">Satisfy</a> and <a href="http://casework.com.au/window.html" target="_blank">CaseWork</a> businesses, which continue to provide complaint-handling technology to enterprise customers in Australia.</p><p>He’s a Cambridge graduate who clears his head on the yoga mat (he’s working towards certification as an Iyengar teacher) and whenever possible likes to retreat to his off-the-grid country hideout.</p></div><div class="team cell"><div class="amazingPicture" style="background-image: url(../Resources/Images/Aija.png)"></div><div class="cellTitle"><h3>Aija Neilands</h3></div><p>Aija designs consumer interfaces for Post-A-Vox.
