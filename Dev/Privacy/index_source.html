		<ul class='level1'>
			<li>Post-A-Vox is a private service
				<ul class='level2' style='list-style-type: none;'>
					<li><p>Post-A-Vox is a service which delivers messages from individuals to business and government, and their responses, in a private, respectful way.  We will never publish the contents of any message or response without the permission of the individual or organisation concerned.  We understand that our users trust us to safeguard the privacy of their correspondence and to protect their personal information, and we deeply respect that trust.</p>
					<p>We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through Post-A-Vox secure and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. However, Post-A-Vox cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to Post-A-Vox or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>
					<p>Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Post-A-Vox, at all times.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>Information which is provided to us by People who use Post A Vox (App Users)
				<ul class='level2'>
					<li>What we collect
						<ul class='level3'>
							<li>Personal information
								<p>We ask App Users for their name and e-mail address, and a password, in order to use Post A Vox.  We also ask for their phone number, but this is optional.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Voxes sent by App Users
								<p>We save the contents of messages sent by App Users using Post A Vox (Voxes), including text, recordings, photographs the locations as specified during the drafting of Voxes (Vox Contents).</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class='level2'>
					<li>How we use the information we collect from App Users
						<ul class='level3'>
							<li>Managing identity
								<p>We use App Users' personal information to identify them as they log into Post A Vox.  This prevents unauthorised access to Post-A-Vox.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Contact details may be included with messages
								<p>If an App User selects to reveal their personal information (they may opt to reveal their name, with a further option to include email address and/or telephone number) as they create a Vox, these details will be included with the message and will be visible to the organisation who is the recipient of the Vox (the Entity).</p>
								<p>If personal information is not revealed, the recipient will see only that the Vox was sent by sent by "an anonymous Post A Vox user".</p>
								<p>Once this information has been provided by an App User to an Entity, it cannot be revoked.  The App user may, however, opt to provide no contact details (or less contact details) in subsequent Voxes to that Entity.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Delivery of message to Entity
								<p>When a Vox is sent, the Vox Contents are sent to the specified Entity.  The details are otherwise kept private, and will not be published without the consent of both the App User and the Entity.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>Information we collect automatically from App Users
				<ul class='level2'>
					<li>Log information
						<p>We may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:
							<ul style='list-style-type:disc;'>
								<li>details of how Post A Vox was used, such as search queries,</li>
								<li>device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, the date and time of the request and</li>
								<li>device information such as the hardware model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Unique application numbers
						<p>Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about the installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Post A Vox when the Post A Vox app is installed or uninstalled or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.</P>						
					</li>
					<li>Local storage
						<p>We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using application data caches.</P>							
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>Information we collect from the people and organisations we send Voxes to (Entities)
				<ul class='level2'>
					<li>What we collect
						<p>We collect responses to Voxes in the form of email messages, the contents of which are stored in the Post-A-Vox database.  For each message, the name and email address of the respondent are saved, as well as the content of the message.</P>						
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul class='level2'>
					<li>How we use information we collect from Entities
						<p>Each response is delivered to the App User concerned, securely, through the Post-A-Vox app.  The details are otherwise kept private, and will not be published without the consent of the Entity.</P>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>Other times we may share information
				<ul class='level2'>
					<li>For external processing
						<p>We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</P>			
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul class='level2'>
					<li>For legal reasons
						<p>We will share personal information with companies, organisations or individuals outside of Post A Vox if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</P>
						<ul style='list-style-type:disc;'>
							<li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request,</li>
							<li>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations,</li>
							<li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues or</li>
							<li>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Post A Vox users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul class='level2'>
					<li>Usage data 
						<p>We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners - like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.</P>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul class='level2'>
					<li>Analytics 
						<p>We may analyse the contents of Voxes from time to time share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly (showing say trends in complaint handling by industry type).</P>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>Accessing Your personal information
				<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we'll do our best to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it - unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p>
				<p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).</p>
				<p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>
				
			</li>
			
			<li>Location of servers
				<p>Please note that information collected by Post A Vox may be hosted or processed on computer servers outside of your home country. </p>
				<p>Therefore, your information may be processed and stored in a jurisdiction other than your home country. As a result, depending on the applicable law, foreign governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through laws applicable in the relevant jurisdiction.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>How to contact us
				<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@postavox.com" style='font-size:16px;'>info@postavox.com</a>.</p>				
			</li>
			
			<li>Changes to our privacy policy
				<p>Post A Vox may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review it periodically. We may provide you additional forms of notice of modifications or updates as appropriate under the circumstances. Your continued use of Post A Vox or the Service after any modification to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such modification.</p>
