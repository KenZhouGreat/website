					<h3>Are communications in Post-A-Vox visible to the public?</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					No. Post-A-Vox is private. We will not publish what you say or what your consumers say to you without your express permission. See <a href=".">Privacy</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question cell">
				<div class="cellTitle">
					<h3>We already have a Contact Us page, why would people use Post-A-Vox?</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Post-A-Vox is a mobile app. Contact Us pages and web forms are awkward for consumers to use from mobile devices because a web search is usually required followed by interacting with a form which is not optimized for mobile use. Post-A-Vox provides an ultra-convenient platform for consumers to engage with you, even if they are not sitting in front of a computer monitor.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question cell">
				<div class="cellTitle">
					<h3>Why is my organisation listed?</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Your organisation may be listed because a consumer requested it to be added, or we may have added your organisation as part of the selected group of major brands and organisations during the initial implementation of Post-A-Vox.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question cell">
				<div class="cellTitle">
					<h3>Can I take myself off the list?</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					The entries on the list are controlled by what consumers ask for and Post-A-Vox users have the ability to add entries themselves. So whilst we could remove your listing if you request it, it is possible that someone will add it again.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question cell">
				<div class="cellTitle">
					<h3>How do I add my organisation to the list?</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					You can add it via Post-A-Vox. Download the app, search to see if you're there already and if not, follow the prompts to add yourself or your organisation.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question cell">
				<div class="cellTitle">
					<h3>What if I receive Voxes that are vexatious, annoying or offensive?</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Post-A-Vox exists to make the world a nicer place, so if you feel the message you have received is vexatious, inappropriate or that the sender is insincere, please contact us. Such messages are bad news for us because we want to provide a useful and meaningful service for you. That's what we're here for. We have systems in place which monitor for offensive or inappropriate content, which may result in messages being removed prior to reaching you. Our <a href=".">terms of service</a> also state that we may filter out such messages or even suspend users who send malicious messages, or behave in an annoying way, such as repeatedly sending the same message.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question cell">
				<div class="cellTitle">
					<h3>How do I respond?</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					The easiest way to respond is simply to reply to the email we send you. This will result in your response being delivered to the consumer via the Post-A-Vox app and they will see a notification when it arrives. Some consumers may opt to include their email address and/or phone number in which case you have the option to correspond with them directly. It's entirely your choice.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question cell">
				<div class="cellTitle">
					<h3>Why can consumers complain anonymously?</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					While we want it to be ok to complain, we understand that not everyone will feel comfortable providing their personal details at the beginning. Their Vox may still provide some insights to an organisation. They have the option to change their privacy settings later.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question cell">
				<div class="cellTitle">
					<h3>Can I integrate Post-A-Vox with my existing customer feedback system?</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Yes. Post-A-Vox will be progressively building tools which will allow you to automate the receipt of messages into third party systems. Contact us if you'd like more information.
