						<h3>How does Post-A-Vox work?</h3>
					</div>					
					<p>When you send a Vox from your mobile, the Post-A-Vox system forwards it directly to the organisation or person you have selected, in the form of an email addressed to the appropriate department.  After they receive it, the recipient can respond via Post-A-Vox, which means you'll see the response in Post-A-Vox on your phone (you'll get a notification when the response arrives). If you've chosen to provide your contact details as part of your Vox, you coould get a response by email or phone instead.</p>					
				</div>
				<div class="question cell">
					<div class="cellTitle">
						<h3>How long should it take to get a reply?</h3>
					</div>					
					<p>Most organisations recognise the value of listening to customers and what they have to say, and have processes to ensure questions and complaints are handled promptly.   In practice, some organisations will answer quickly, while others may be very slow, or may even fail to respond at all .  Post-A-Vox has no control over this, but will always do their best to encourage prompt and meaningful responses.</p>					
				</div>
				<div class="question cell">
					<div class="cellTitle">
						<h3>How do I know the response is real?</h3>
					</div>					
					<p>All email addresses and contact points are verified so you can be assured that your message only goes to the organisation or person you have selected. Your Vox is only seen by them and therefore only they can respond.</p>					
				</div>
				<div class="question cell">
					<div class="cellTitle">
						<h3>I have posted a Vox and not received a reply for several days. What happens now?</h3>
					</div>					
					<p>Sometimes organizations just don't answer consumersâ€™ questions and they have their own reasons for that.  If your Vox is in breach of our <a href=".">terms of service</a>, it may have been removed before it was delivered. You will see the word "Removed" if this is the case.</p>					
				</div>
				<div class="question cell">
					<div class="cellTitle">
						<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
					</div>					
					<p>The Post-A-Vox app is free. </p>					
				</div>
				<div class="question cell">
					<div class="cellTitle">
						<h3>Most of the entries on the list seem to be from Sydney, Australia.  Does this mean I can't use Post-A-Vox if I'm not in Sydney?</h3>
					</div>					
					<p>Post-A-Vox is a global service, but we've launched in Sydney because that's where most of us spend most of the time.  If you're not in Sydney and you want to send a Vox, go right ahead.  If you need to add someone to the list from your region, you can do this easily.  Search for them in the list, and if you can't find what you're looking for, follow the prompt to add a listing, then Post your Vox.</p>					
				</div>
				<div class="question cell">
					<div class="cellTitle">
						<h3>Why would I use Post-A-Vox rather than email or contact us pages?</h3>
					</div>					
					<p>It's just easier.  Post-A-Vox gives you access to thousands of organisations and brands in the palm of your hand with no need to search for individual email addresses or web pages.</p>					
				</div>
				<div class="question cell">
					<div class="cellTitle">
						<h3>Who can see what I have written?</h3>
					</div>					
					<p>Only you and your Vox recipient can see your messages. Of course you get to see the responses too.  Post-A-Vox is a private service and we would never publish any communication without your permission.  See <a href=".">Privacy</a>.</p>					
				</div>
				<div class="question cell">
					<div class="cellTitle">
						<h3>Can I make my Voxes public?</h3>
					</div>					
					<p>Currently we do not provide an option for you to make your Voxes public.  We figure that if you like speaking publicly you'll already be using social media like Twitter or Facebook to broadcast your message. </p>					
				</div>
				<div class="question cell">
					<div class="cellTitle">
						<h3>Is Post-A-Vox just for complaints and comments?  Could I also use it to ask questions or make suggestions?</h3>
					</div>					
					<p>You are welcome to use Post-A-Vox for all comments, questions as well as complaints.</p>
